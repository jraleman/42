## Overview

Repository of my work during the 42 program, that follows a logical sequence of
17 long-lasting skills that speak to businesses. These skills also have the same
fundamental element: personal adaptability, learning, coping and solving new
challenges that they will inevitably face regularly. Even if it has a few
obligatory paths, 42’s program is individually tailored throughout their
educational experience. Many classical themes are addressed in order to develop
the skills they contain, like:
* Computer Science / Programming
* Innovation
* Infrastructures
* Personal Development and Expression
* Entrepreneurship
